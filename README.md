# Overview

This repository is a working notepad of solutions for a few problems in the [HackerRank challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges).

My HackerRank profile is [https://www.hackerrank.com/dnastacio], where you can see my current ranking and a complete list of problem submissions.

## Why HackerRank?

After many years doing architecture and operations, I always thought I could go back to coding in high-level languages instantaneously.

Until one day, I was asked to look into a file with a thousand lines of Python code (for work) and could not immediately understand or modify it.

Decades of coding in different programming languages do not necessarily mean I could be as fluent in a new (for me) programming language.

My team is not a Python shop - far from it - but that is what a colleague chose to use right before he left. Python was not a wrong choice for the problem at hand, and I also felt it was a professional blindspot not to be fluent in such a popular programming language.

It took me about two weeks to complete the Python badge. While decades of programming experience do not give you immediate fluency in all programming languages, it still allows acquiring fluency rather quickly.

With the Python badge in hand, I noticed a particular "rust" in tackling the math/puzzle problems I used to love decades ago, so I also started solving those challenges.

## Coverage

This repository does not contain a solution to every challenge on the HackerRank website.

My criteria for committing problem submissions to this repository, so far, have been:

1. Problems I found particularly interesting.
2. Problems where people asked clarifying questions in the comments section, and I didn't feel like horseshoeing long stretches of text with complex formatting in the limited space in the forms.

## Contents for each folder

Each problem is assigned to a folder in this repository containing the following:

1. A README.md file containing a link to the original problem and my thought process on solving the problem.
2. A source code file with the problem resolution after clearing all test cases available when submitting the problem.
3. A testcase or two where the submission of a solution failed, and the testcase was too complex to debug on the HackerRank website.
